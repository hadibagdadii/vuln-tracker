With the nearby South and West dormitories, and East Hall, which served as a dining facility, this area was the principal living area for the students of the budding agricultural college.

Housing sixty-seven men, the hall also had a three-bed ward that served as the campus' first infirmary until an alternative area was set up in 1922.  All three of the halls remained in service as dormitories until West Hall was razed in 1951 to clear the site for the Memorial Union.  In 1961, South Hall was converted to office space."

TB-9 is eligible for the National Register of Historic Places under Criterion A because it is the site where the Funk Figurative Ceramics Movement began, a movement that was influential in altering the history of American ceramics.  TB-9 is also eligible for the National Register under Criterion B because Robert Arneson, a nationally acclaimed ceramic artist who started the Funk Figurative Ceramics Movement, produced his most significant and influential work in his studio at TB-9.  Even though Robert Arneson retained his affiliation with TB-9 through his retirement in 1991, by 1976 he had moved to Benicia and created the majority of his later work at his studio there. Also, by the mid-1970's, Funk Figurative Ceramics was a well-established and recognized art movement.  Because of Arneson's fame and reputation as an innovative teacher, the ceramics program at Davis became impacted. Admission to the program became highly selective due to excessive applications.  Arneson no longer had control of recruiting or selecting students, leading to a more institutional, rigorous and formal atmosphere. Innovation and creativity yielded to a self-conscious and conforming attitude, especially after Arneson stopped working exclusively in his TB-9 studio.  2) Because TB-9's period of significance ends within the past fifty years, the building is not eligible for the National Register without establishing its exceptional significance under Criteria Consideration G.  3) An in-depth scholarly evaluation of TB-9 demonstrates how the development of the Funk Figurative Ceramics Movement at this site and its affiliation with Robert Arneson, the nationally and internationally recognized founder of this movement contributed to the history of American ceramics in a way that meets the requirement for exceptional significance."

During the first two years, law students met in other campus buildings.  The two-story, concrete-and-brick King Hall was built along Putah Creek, across from Mrak Hall, and was dedicated to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on April 12, 1969.  The first campus building to be named after a major national figure, King Hall was expanded in 1976 with the addition of a lower level.  A major expansion and renovation project broke ground on September 29, 2007, with the expansion completed in Summer 2010 and the renovation of the original wing completed in 2013."

The 1928 building was the original Sacramento County Hospital, and is constructed of unreinforced masonry.  In the 1950s a light steel-framed addition was built around and on top of the original building, increasing its height to six stories and extending it to the north. The structure is known as the North/South Wing.  In 1964, it underwent a significant addition and remodel and added the East Wing on the east side of the structure.  In 1982 the University Tower (9493) was constructed; and in 1997 the Health System opened the Davis Tower. The collection of these connected structures comprises the current Main Hospital."
